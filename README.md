 ## Game Overview
 In this game, you play as a turret, and your goal is to shoot the green squares while avoiding the red squares. 

 ## Key Challenges
 This project pushed me to learn a ton about not only the C++ 17 toolset (updated variadic templates, anyone?), but also a wide array of game programming patterns in general. some things to learn that were completely new to me include: 
- Entity Component Systems
- Object Pooling
- Level Generation (Cellular Automata)
